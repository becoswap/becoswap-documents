# NFT Marketplace

**BecoSwap NFT marketplace** is a curated NFT platform that spotlights top emerging artists with the purpose of helping, empowering and adding value to those creative minds that are constantly challenging themselves in the creative field. New global marketplace will become the premier destination for NFTs and digital collectibles across mediums, from visual arts and gaming to music and sports. Aim is to provide the NFT trading platform in the world with the best minting, buying and exchanging experience, by leveraging the fastest and cheapest solutions powered by blockchain infrastructure and community.

**Inside our NFT Marketplace**, regarding to art, you could find almost everything:

* **Artists** for new promising Artists.
* **Meme Contests** for cobranded activities with partners, or directly NFT issued by them.

**And beyond Art**, you could also find lots of gamification and NFT + DeFi solutions such as **In-game Pets** like $DPET.

After few focus groups with both investors and artists, we decided that to attract the talent, we needed a platform with a quality look and feel of this brand new, multi-purpose and fully functional marketplace, and also a curated one, to raise the collectible value, and attract investors to KardiaChain. We can also complement our KardiaChain Artists, that can keep working hard to be promoted to Featured, and have the rights to expose at BecoSwap NFT marketplace.

## **Voting**

You will be able to vote for your favorite artworks and push them on top of the homepage. The more votes an artwork has, the higher it ranks. We can see that there is a "Like" button in the bottom right corner of each NFT. When you click the "Like" button, a popup for voting will appear for you to approve and vote. Then input the amount of BECO you want to vote in. 1 vote needs 1 BECO. You can put in more BECO if you’d like to give more votes! Then click the “Vote Now” button in the pop-up to complete the vote.

Owners of an NFT artwork will get half of the BECO voted, and BecoSwap will get the remaining part for operational use. The more votes an artwork has, the higher it ranks on the homepage. And we have also added ranking by votes in the NFT marketplace. The BECO voting amount is separated and transferred to original authors right after the vote is sent.
